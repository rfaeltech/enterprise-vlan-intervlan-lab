### Step 1: Install Cisco Packet Tracer

Before using this lab, ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer. You can download it from the Cisco website. Follow their instructions for installation, which is straightforward and user-friendly.

### Step 2: Download the Lab Files

Once Packet Tracer is installed, go back to the [Releases page](https://github.com/rfaeltech/enterprise-vlan-intervlan-lab/releases). Look for the latest version and download the ZIP file that contains the lab files. It will typically have a name like `enterprise-vlan-intervlan-lab-v1.0.zip`.

### Step 3: Extract the Files

After the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in your downloads folder. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All". Choose a convenient location on your computer to store the extracted files.

### Step 4: Open the Lab in Packet Tracer

1. Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Click on "File" in the upper left corner.
3. Select "Open" from the dropdown menu.
4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the lab files and select the file named `enterprise-vlan-intervlan-lab.pkt`.

### Step 5: Explore the Network Setup

Once you have opened the lab file, you will see a visual representation of the enterprise network. This lab demonstrates several key networking concepts:

- **VLAN Segmentation:** The network is divided into different VLANs for better data management.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** This allows communication between different VLANs using a router.
- **DHCP Services:** Automatic IP assignment to devices within the network.

Feel free to explore the different components and configurations in the Packet Tracer simulation.

### Step 6: Run the Simulation

To see the network in action, click the "Play" button at the bottom of the Packet Tracer window. This starts the simulation, allowing you to observe how data flows between devices and the DHCP service operates smoothly.

## üí° Features

- **Visual Networking:** A clear layout of router, switches, and devices to enhance understanding.
- **Hands-On Experience:** Get practical experience with VLANs and DHCP.
- **Step-by-Step Lab:** Easy for beginners to follow along.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Modify settings and see how changes affect network behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** Ensure you have the latest version installed (recommended version).
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, MacOS, or Linux (with compatibility).
- **RAM:** Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended for better performance).
- **Storage:** Ensure you have at least 1GB available for the files and Packet Tracer.
